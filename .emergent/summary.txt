The previous AI engineer successfully developed a full-stack application (frontend-only for now) for Vox Radio, replicating the design of the Kioo Radio presenters dashboard. The project began with a pixel-perfect frontend clone using mock data and an orange/black color scheme derived from the Vox Radio logo. Over several iterations, the engineer implemented extensive UI/UX refinements, added dynamic features like a rotating weather display for Liberian cities, a comprehensive live radio stream with dual listening options, and a dynamic program schedule that highlights current shows and presenters. Critical tasks included fixing form submissions using , reorganizing content for better usability, integrating real-time notifications, and displaying accurate Liberia time. The engineer also addressed multiple design change requests, including the removal of sections like AI Analytics and Flight Information as per user feedback, and then re-integrating accurate program data supplied by the user. The last major achievement was making the entire application fully mobile-responsive. The current interaction left off with the user requesting further refinements to the program list, changing weather units to Fahrenheit, and a general emphasis on mobile-first design, which the AI acknowledged and is about to start.

<product_requirements>
The primary goal is to create a pixel-perfect clone of the Kioo Radio presenters dashboard (https://kiooradio.org/kioo-presenters-dashboard-1981) for Vox Radio. The application must use the color scheme from the Vox Radio logo (orange/black) and mirror the original site's design, layout, fonts, images, animations, structure, interactive elements, navigation, and responsive behavior across devices.

**Implemented Features:**
*   **Frontend Clone:** Initial pixel-perfect replica of the dashboard layout.
*   **Branding:** Adopted Vox Radio's orange and black color scheme.
*   **Navigation & Layout:** Removed unnecessary top links, launch announcements, and language selectors.
*   **Contact:** Integrated WhatsApp with a specific number (0777975975).
*   **Current Weather:** Displays real-time weather for Liberian cities (Monrovia, Gbarnga, Buchanan, Kakata, Harper, Greenville, etc.) with a 15-minute rotation feature across different regions.
*   **Live Stream:** Functional Listen Live button opening in a low-bandwidth optimized popup, and an embedded, toggleable radio player using a specified URL ().
*   **Forms (Mocked):** Submit Testimony and Log Phone Call forms are functional, saving data to local storage.
*   **Recent Submissions (Mocked):** Centralized display for all submitted testimonies, phone calls, and WhatsApp messages, with real-time updates and persistence via local storage.
*   **Notifications:** Real-time toast notifications for new testimonies, phone calls, and WhatsApp messages.
*   **Liberia Time:** A visually distinctive, animated clock displaying accurate Liberia time (GMT+0) and date prominently in the top navigation bar.
*   **Presenter Management:** Log Phone Call features an alphabetically sorted list of Vox Radio presenters.
*   **Program Schedule:** A dynamic, scrolling program schedule prominently displayed, automatically highlighting the current program in bold with NOW LIVE indicator and presenter name based on Liberia time.
*   **Mobile Responsiveness:** The entire application is fully optimized for mobile devices, including responsive navigation, layouts, and interactive elements.

**Removed Features:**
*   AI Analytics section (after initial implementation).
*   Flight Information section (after initial implementation and subsequent accurate data integration).

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard React frontend structure. The core application logic resides in  which defines routes, and  which acts as the main container for the dashboard features. Styling is handled by  via  and . Mock data and utility functions are managed within the  directory (e.g., ). New functional components are organized under .



**Key Files and Changes:**

*   ****:
    *   **Importance:** Main entry point for the React application, sets up  and .
    *   **Changes:** Integrated various new components like , , , and . Also included global CSS and removed the initial placeholder  component.
*   ****:
    *   **Importance:** The central layout component for the entire Vox Radio dashboard. It orchestrates the display of various sub-components (weather, WhatsApp, forms, etc.) and manages state for tab navigation.
    *   **Changes:** Underwent significant modifications throughout the trajectory. It now imports and renders , , , , , , and conditionally renders content based on the active tab (e.g., , ). It also handles  interactions for managing data across different functional sections.
*   ****:
    *   **Importance:** Contains the top navigation bar of the dashboard.
    *   **Changes:** Modified to remove various links, incorporate the Listen Live button functionality (popup window for stream), and host the distinct  component.
*   ****:
    *   **Importance:** Displays weather information for Liberian cities.
    *   **Changes:** Initialized with mock Atlanta data, then updated for Liberian cities (Monrovia, Gbarnga, Buchanan, Kakata, etc.). Crucially, a 15-minute rotation logic was implemented to cycle through different sets of Liberian cities, providing dynamic weather updates.
*   ****:
    *   **Importance:** Dynamically displays the radio station's program schedule.
    *   **Changes:** This file was newly created. It fetches program data (initially mocked, then updated from user-provided data), displays it in a marquee, and highlights the current program in bold with presenter names based on Liberia time. It also includes NOW LIVE and SOON indicators.
*   ****:
    *   **Importance:** Displays the current time and date in Liberia.
    *   **Changes:** Newly created and later extensively restyled to be a prominent, animated one of a kind centerpiece in the top navigation bar with a gradient background.
*   ****:
    *   **Importance:** Provides an embedded, toggleable audio player for the live radio stream.
    *   **Changes:** Newly created to offer an alternative to the popup player, optimized for low bandwidth, with play/pause and volume controls.
*   ****, ****, ****:
    *   **Importance:** These are the core forms for presenter interactions.
    *   **Changes:** Implemented with  for data persistence, form validation, and dedicated sections. Submit Testimony was separated from . Add Message functionality for WhatsApp was fixed. Presenter names in Log Phone Call were updated.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer had just completed a significant update to the **Program Schedule**. The user provided new, accurate program data (via an image, after some clarification on file formats), including specific program names, days, times, and presenter names. The AI engineer updated the  file to reflect this new data.

The current state of the product is that the dashboard displays a dynamic, scrolling program schedule at the top, which automatically highlights the *current* program in bold with a NOW LIVE: [Program Name] with [Presenter Name] indicator, based on Liberia's local time. It correctly shows a comprehensive list of 22 programs covering Monday-Sunday schedules, complete with their assigned presenters. The application is fully mobile-responsive and all previously implemented features (rotating Liberian weather, live radio stream, functional forms saving to , real-time notifications, distinctive Liberia time, alphabetical presenter list) are working as expected. The forms are blank and ready for user input. The application is a feature-rich, frontend-only prototype using mock data persisted in .
