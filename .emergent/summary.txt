The AI engineer's work transitioned from foundational features to complex integrations. Initially, the focus was on a mobile-responsive Vox Radio dashboard with real-time Liberian weather, a live stream, and local storage forms. Key challenges included React re-render loops and evolving program schedule requirements, leading to the Vox Radio 24/7 Program Log. Deployment errors were addressed, and  timezone consistency was ensured. A comprehensive Cleanfeed integration was initiated but then redirected. The primary recent work involved implementing a detailed VDO.Ninja remote broadcast integration and a Broadcast Clocks page with airtime analytics, followed by debugging persistent React re-render issues across multiple components. Despite efforts and troubleshooting, the re-render issue on the Studio tab, impacting VDO.Ninja, remained unresolved. Backend testing for VDO.Ninja passed, and the Broadcast Clocks page was fully implemented. New user requests include an embedded live stream player and expanded Liberian weather data.

The objective is to build a mobile-responsive Vox Radio dashboard, visually inspired by Kioo Radio (orange/black theme). It requires displaying real-time Liberian weather (Fahrenheit, detailed rain predictions) and offering a live radio stream. Core interactive elements include local storage-backed forms (Submit Testimony, Log Phone Call, WhatsApp Management) with real-time notifications. An animated Liberia time display is crucial. The application features a comprehensive Vox Radio 24/7 Program Log in 24-hour format, with color-coding, search, filters, LIVE NOW indicators, NEXT UP countdown, and download functionalities. All time-related displays (program log, weather) must use the  timezone. The dashboard also integrates Cleanfeed.net for remote studio access, enabling quick launch, guest link sharing, presenter instructions, and configuration settings (though the settings tab was later removed). Recent user requests introduced VDO.Ninja integration for remote broadcasting, including link storage, audio parameters, director/guest link composition, and sharing options. A Broadcast Clocks page with airtime analytics (monthly/yearly, program/language distribution, analytics cards, download options) was also requested. Current requests include replacing the pop-up stream player with an embedded player and expanding the weather report to cover all major Liberian cities/counties.

<code_architecture>
The application consists of a React frontend () and a Python/FastAPI backend ().



-   ****: FastAPI backend. Modified to include new  endpoints for storing and retrieving VDO.Ninja configuration, supporting GET and POST requests.
-   ****: Manages the main dashboard tabs. Modified to remove the Settings tab and add a new Broadcast Clocks tab.
-   ****: The main dashboard layout. Modified to remove the import and usage of  and add the  component.
-   ****: Handles Cleanfeed studio access. Modified to integrate the new  component, allowing users to switch between Cleanfeed and VDO.Ninja options. Fixes were applied to address React re-render issues by correctly placing  outside the component and adjusting  dependencies.
-   ****: (Created) This new component implements the VDO.Ninja integration, including fields for director/guest URLs, toggles for audio parameters, bitrate input, and buttons to open/copy/share links and display presenter instructions. Fixes were applied for React re-render loops by correctly declaring .
-   ****: (Created) This new component displays an interactive 24-hour clock, daily schedule, weekly language distribution, and airtime analytics with download options, mirroring the Kioo Radio design.
-   ****: Displays current weather. Modified to fix React re-render issues by moving  declaration outside the component function and adjusting  dependencies.
-   ****: Displays a 2-day weather forecast. Modified to fix React re-render issues by moving  declaration outside the component function and adjusting  dependencies.
-   ****: (Created, Modified) Component for Cleanfeed settings. It was created and then modified to fix React re-render issues by moving  declaration outside the component function and adjusting  dependencies, though it was subsequently removed from the main dashboard navigation.
-   ****: (Created, Inspected) A custom hook for program schedule logic. It was identified by the  as a root cause of re-render issues, despite the AI engineer's assessment that its  usage and dependencies were correct.

<pending_tasks>
- Implement an embedded live radio stream player with play/pause, volume, current song info, mute, and mobile-friendly compact design.
- Expand the weather report to include all major cities and counties of Liberia.
- Investigate and resolve the persistent Maximum update depth exceeded infinite re-render issue affecting the Studio tab, specifically the VDO.Ninja integration.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer successfully implemented the VDO.Ninja remote broadcast integration and a new Broadcast Clocks page.

For **VDO.Ninja**, a new component () was created and integrated into the existing  within the Studio tab. Backend endpoints () were added to  for persistent storage of VDO.Ninja configuration (director/guest URLs, audio parameters, bitrate). The Settings tab and  were removed from the dashboard as per user request.

For **Broadcast Clocks**, a new component () was created, added to , and integrated into . This page displays an interactive 24-hour clock, daily schedule, weekly language distribution, and airtime analytics with download options (PNG, CSV), matching the Kioo Radio reference. This feature is fully implemented and visually verified with screenshots.

However, a critical issue persists: the Studio tab, containing the VDO.Ninja integration, continues to experience an Maximum update depth exceeded infinite re-render loop. Despite multiple debugging attempts, including calls to a troubleshooting agent, and fixing  dependency issues in , , , , and , the problem remains. The troubleshooting agent last pointed to  as the root cause, but the AI engineer's subsequent review did not identify an issue there. A recent screenshot attempt for the Studio tab resulted in a timeout error, indicating the severity of the rendering problem. Backend tests for the VDO.Ninja APIs passed successfully, confirming server-side functionality.
