The AI engineer successfully transformed the Vox Radio dashboard from a Kioo Radio clone into a feature-rich, mobile-responsive application. Initial efforts focused on pixel-perfect UI, branding, and core features like rotating weather, live stream, local storage-backed forms, and a dynamic program schedule. A significant challenge involved persistent React infinite re-render loops in components like , , and , which were methodically debugged by refactoring  object instantiations and implementing . A crucial pivot involved integrating a user-provided, professionally organized HTML schedule, which led to the creation of an Enhanced Schedule component. This was further expanded with search, favorites, and a dedicated full-page view. The most recent task involved redesigning the enhanced schedule to mirror Kioo Radio's program page layout for improved aesthetics and usability, and removing the Show Player functionality, which is currently in progress.

The goal is to create a pixel-perfect, mobile-responsive clone of the Kioo Radio presenters dashboard for Vox Radio, adopting an orange/black color scheme. The dashboard needs to display real-time Liberian weather (convertible to Fahrenheit), offer a live radio stream, and include functional forms for Submit Testimony, Log Phone Call, and WhatsApp Management with local storage persistence and real-time notifications. A prominent, animated Liberia time display is required. The application must feature a dynamic program schedule, initially a scrolling marquee, then expanded to a comprehensive 7-day view with search and favorites, reflecting user-provided organized data. Previously, AI Analytics and Flight Information were removed. The latest request is to redesign the program display to visually match the Kioo Radio programs page, including real-time highlighting of the current program, and to remove Show Player functionality.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer had just completed successfully implementing an expanded 7-day program schedule with search, favorites, and a dedicated full-page view, fully resolving previous re-rendering issues and fixing an icon import error ( to ). The user then requested a significant redesign of the program display, specifically to use the system found on the Kioo Radio programs page for a more beautiful and user-friendly interface. This new display needs to highlight the currently airing program and its presenter in real-time. Additionally, the user requested the removal of all Show Player functionality. The AI engineer analyzed the Kioo Radio programs page, confirmed a clean table-based layout, and then **completely rewrote the  component to implement this new Kioo Radio-inspired table layout**. The next immediate action is to locate and remove all Show Player references and related radio player functionality from the dashboard.
