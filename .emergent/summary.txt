The AI engineer successfully transformed the Vox Radio dashboard, iteratively adding complex features and refining the UI. Key initial efforts included mobile responsiveness, real-time weather, a live stream, local storage-backed forms, and a dynamic program schedule. Persistent React re-render loops in components like , , and  were debugged using  and refactored date instantiations. A significant pivot involved integrating a user-provided HTML schedule, leading to the Enhanced Schedule component, which evolved to include search and favorites. The engineer later fully rewrote this component to match a Kioo Radio-inspired table layout and removed Show Player functionality.

Subsequent work included converting the schedule to a 24-hour format, adding a 2-day weather forecast for Liberian cities, and removing the Made with Emergent logo. Debugging efforts revealed and fixed a recurring infinite re-render loop related to  objects and timezone issues. The user then requested a comprehensive Vox Radio 24/7 Program Log based on an uploaded Excel file, which the engineer fully implemented, including color-coding, advanced search, upcoming programs, and download functionality. The most recent task involved removing the Enhanced Schedule, simplifying the live program banner with animated audio waves, and implementing a new scrolling marquee for program info in the header, which is currently blocked by an import error after deleting the old  component.

The objective is to develop a pixel-perfect, mobile-responsive dashboard for Vox Radio that mirrors the Kioo Radio presenters' dashboard, adhering to an orange/black theme. The application needs to display real-time Liberian weather (convertible to Fahrenheit), offer a live radio stream, and integrate functional forms (Submit Testimony, Log Phone Call, WhatsApp Management) with local storage and real-time notifications. A prominent, animated Liberia time display is crucial. The core functionality includes a dynamic program schedule, evolving from a scrolling marquee to a comprehensive 7-day view with search and favorites. AI Analytics and Flight Information features were explicitly removed. Recent requirements involved redesigning the program display to match the Kioo Radio programs page, featuring real-time highlighting of the current program and presenter, a 24-hour clock format, and a 2-day weather forecast for Liberian cities with a 30-minute refresh, initially on the dashboard then moved to a separate page. All Show Player functionality was to be removed. Finally, a comprehensive Vox Radio 24/7 Program Log system, based on an Excel file, was requested, featuring live Now Playing banners, color-coded weekly schedules, search, filters, upcoming programs, and download capabilities. The latest request is to simplify the live program display under the header with audio waves, remove the old Enhanced Schedule, and implement a new scrolling marquee for program details.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard React project structure, primarily organized within the  directory, with a Python/FastAPI backend in .



-   ****: Serves as the main routing file. It was modified to remove the  component and the  route.
-   ****: Global CSS file, recently updated to include  for the new marquee scrolling animation in the header.
-   ****: The main layout component. It was modified to remove the Show Player functionality, manage tab state, include the  component, and later remove the  component.
-   ****: Displays the main title and real-time information. It was modified to display the presenter name and program under Vox Radio Presenters Dashboard, to remove the Real-time updates and management tools subtitle, to incorporate and then simplify the LIVE NOW program highlighting (changing from red banner to orange audio waves), and most recently to include a scrolling marquee for current/next program info. Debugging code for re-renders and timezone issues was added and later cleaned up.
-   ****: Displays current weather. Modified to convert temperature to Fahrenheit, and later enhanced to include a 2-day forecast for Liberian counties and cities with 30-minute refresh. This 2-day forecast section was then moved to a new  component to clean up .
-   ****: (Deleted) This component was initially created and later completely rewritten to integrate user's HTML schedule, then expanded for 7-day view, search, and favorites, adopting a Kioo Radio-inspired table layout. It was ultimately removed and replaced by .
-   ****: Created for a dedicated schedule view, it was modified for display and navigation. It currently causes a compilation error due to a lingering import of the deleted .
-   ****: Contains navigation elements. It was examined to confirm Listen Live functionality was present and separate from Show Player.
-   ****: Manages the tab interface. Modified to add and later remove the Enhanced Schedule tab, then added Weather Forecast and Program Log tabs.
-   ****: (Created) This new component now houses the detailed 2-day weather forecast for Liberian counties and cities with auto-refresh functionality, separated from the  component.
-   ****: (Created) This is the new, comprehensive program log component, replacing the . It displays a color-coded weekly schedule from an Excel file, with search, filters, upcoming programs, and download functionality. The green Now Playing banner was recently removed from this component.
-   ****: Stores mock data. Updated weather data to Fahrenheit.
-   ****: A utility file. A function  was added here to help retrieve live program details for display.
-   ****: The main HTML file. The Made with Emergent logo reference was removed from this file.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was implementing a series of changes requested by the user. The primary goal was to refactor the display of program information within the dashboard header.

First, the existing Enhanced Schedule component and its related content were removed from the application, including the file , along with updates to , , and  to remove references to it.

Next, the green Now Playing banner from the  component was removed.

Following this, significant modifications were made to  to accommodate the new requirements:
- The current program and presenter display was updated.
- A new scrolling marquee effect for program, day, and presenter information was being integrated.
- Logic to display the NEXT PROGRAM at the top of the header was being added.
- The necessary CSS keyframes for the marquee animation were added to .

After these code changes, the AI engineer attempted to take a screenshot to verify the implementation. This resulted in a frontend compilation error, specifically indicating that  is still trying to import the  component, which has already been deleted. This error is currently blocking further verification and indicates that the cleanup of the old Enhanced Schedule was not fully complete.
