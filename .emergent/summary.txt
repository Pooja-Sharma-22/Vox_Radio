The previous AI engineer successfully initiated the Vox Radio dashboard, incrementally adding features and refactoring existing ones based on continuous user feedback. The journey began with foundational elements like mobile responsiveness, real-time weather, a live stream, and functional forms. Early challenges included resolving persistent React re-render loops and integrating a user-provided HTML schedule. This led to the creation and subsequent removal of the Enhanced Schedule, replaced by a comprehensive Vox Radio 24/7 Program Log.

Significant work involved converting the schedule to a 24-hour format, adding a 2-day weather forecast, and implementing a new scrolling marquee for program info, which was later removed at the user's request. The engineer tackled multiple rounds of deployment errors, identifying and fixing package manager issues, environment variable misconfigurations, and hardcoded URLs. Recent efforts focused on implementing detailed rain predictions for Liberia, ensuring all program log times display in  timezone, and integrating Cleanfeed.net studio access. The latest iteration involves a more advanced Cleanfeed integration, including dedicated settings, studio controls, and secure handling of credentials, which is currently in progress.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to develop a mobile-responsive Vox Radio dashboard, mirroring the Kioo Radio design with an orange/black theme. It must display real-time Liberian weather (Fahrenheit, with detailed rain predictions), offer a live radio stream, and integrate local storage-backed forms (Submit Testimony, Log Phone Call, WhatsApp Management) with real-time notifications. Key features include an animated Liberia time display, a dynamic program schedule evolving into a comprehensive Vox Radio 24/7 Program Log with 24-hour format, color-coding, search, filters, upcoming programs, and download capabilities. This program log and all weather updates must display times in  (UTC+0), featuring a LIVE NOW indicator and a NEXT UP countdown. The application also requires a Cleanfeed.net integration for remote broadcast studio access, including quick launch, guest link sharing, presenter instructions, and a settings panel for configuration. Initially, AI Analytics and Flight Information were explicitly removed. The design should prioritize mobile-first principles.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively working on a comprehensive Cleanfeed integration, following a detailed user specification. This involved:
1.  **Enhancing Backend**: Modifying  to support Cleanfeed settings, likely for secure storage of host credentials.
2.  **Developing **: This component was being refactored to include features like opening the host studio, copying guest links, sharing via WhatsApp/Email, displaying presenter instructions (with token replacement), a user checklist, and troubleshooting tips. It also includes Chrome-specific optimizations for launching.
3.  **Creating **: A new component was created to manage Cleanfeed configurations, including guest URL, presenter instructions, and placeholder fields for admin-only host credentials.
4.  **Integrating into Dashboard**: Attempts were made to add the  component to the main .

The last recorded action (Chat Message 521) indicates the AI was working on Step 7: Update Environment Variables for Cleanfeed, which suggests setting up  and  based on the new detailed requirements, and possibly also handling the host credentials securely. The  tab was initially added to  but then explicitly requested to be removed.
